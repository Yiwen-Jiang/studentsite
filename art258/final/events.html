                        Do you love chocolate and thirst to learn more about how cacao is grown and made
                        into chocolate? Never tasted the delicious lychee or mangosteen-flavored pulp of
                        the cacao fruit? Want to see how the days-long process of fermenting cacao affects
                        the micro-terroir of the chocolate flavor? This is the perfect tour for you! We’re
                        having a cacao boot camp with everyone from Hawaii, mainland, European, and beyond
                        chocolate makers and chocophiles coming out here to experience and learn cacao planting,
                        cultivation, harvest, and fermentation and chocolate making for 5 days.

                    <p>
                        We’ll introduce you to the cacao growers and fermenters throughout Oahu, an area
                        we call the Napa Valley of cacao due to the amazing diversity of cacao flavors and
                        microclimates in each valley up and down Windward Oahu and the North Shore. Each
                        day we’ll visit, learn, and participate in a different aspect of cacao growing and
                        processing with expert farmers, fermenters, agroforesters, university researchers,
                        and chocolate makers in Hawaii’s burgeoning chocolate industry. In the only place
                        in the US where cacao grows, you’ll have beautiful accommodations near the beaches
                        of Lani Kai and Kailua or famous Waikiki, and you’ll be driven between each of the
                        spots each day, with time off in the evenings to enjoy all the amazing local food
                        that Kailua and Honolulu has to offer.

                    <p>
                        Walk into the cacao orchards of Oahu the moment you step off the plane and begin
                        your journey into chocolate making, Hawaiian style.
